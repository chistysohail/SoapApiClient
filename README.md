# Super Score Adder: The SOAP Adventure

Welcome to an exhilarating blend of sports and technology! If you're a coach, a player, or just a tech-savvy sports fan, you're about to discover how to elevate the game with digital precision. Our Super Score Adder uses the power of SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) to send sports scores to a global calculator service, get them added up, and display the total faster than a sprinter off the blocks. Let's dive into how you can set this up and run it like a champ.

## Getting Started

Before we kick off, ensure you have the following:

- **.NET SDK**: The toolset that lets you develop and run .NET applications.
- **A Favorite Code Editor**: Visual Studio, VS Code, or any editor that supports C# and .NET development.

## Setting Up Your Project

1. **Create a New Folder**: This will be your project directory.
2. **Add a C# File**: Name it `Program.cs` and paste the provided C# code into this file.
3. **Add Your SOAP Scorecard**: Create an `AddRequest.xml` file with your score adding request in SOAP format.

## The Playbook

Here's a sneak peek of what's happening under the hood:

### Preparing Your Digital Scorecard (`AddRequest.xml`)

Your request to the Global Score Calculator is penned down in this XML file. It's structured to fit SOAP standards, ready to be understood and processed.

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:tem="http://tempuri.org/">
    <soapenv:Header/>
    <soapenv:Body>
        <tem:Add>
            <tem:intA>{Score1}</tem:intA>
            <tem:intB>{Score2}</tem:intB>
        </tem:Add>
    </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>



Making the Play (Your C# Program)
using System.IO;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var url = "http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx";
        var action = "http://tempuri.org/Add";
        var projectDirectory = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory;
        var projectRoot = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(projectDirectory, @"..\..\..\"));
        var filePath = Path.Combine(projectRoot, "AddRequest.xml");
        var soapEnvelopeTemplate = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(filePath);
        var soapEnvelope = soapEnvelopeTemplate.Replace("{Score1}", "5").Replace("{Score2}", "3");

        using (var client = new HttpClient())
        {
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("text/xml"));
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("SOAPAction", action);
            var content = new StringContent(soapEnvelope, System.Text.Encoding.UTF8, "text/xml");
            var response = await client.PostAsync(url, content);
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            var soapResponse = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            System.Console.WriteLine(soapResponse);
        }
    }
}


Let's put these technical details into the context of managing a soccer team, where your goal is to understand how digital tools can enhance your team's strategy and performance analysis.

Imagine your soccer team is gearing up for an important match. In the world of soccer, just like in the digital realm, knowing exactly where to go and what to do is crucial for success. This is where the concept of a url and an action comes into play, similar to a game plan and a specific play within that plan.

The url: The Stadium Where the Game is Played
The url in the code, "http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx", can be likened to the stadium where your soccer team is scheduled to play. Just as you need the address to reach the correct stadium, your digital request needs a URL to know where to send the information. This URL is the location of the web service that's going to process your request, similar to how a stadium hosts the match and provides the setting for your team's actions.

The action: The Play Your Team Decides to Execute
The action, "http://tempuri.org/Add", represents the specific play your team decides to execute during the match. In soccer, a coach might call for a specific play, like a corner kick strategy or a defensive formation, to achieve a particular outcome. Similarly, in the digital realm, the action tells the web service exactly what operation you want to perform. Here, "Add" signifies that you wish to use the calculator service's addition functionality, much like choosing to go for a goal through a well-planned set of passes.

Putting It All Together in the Soccer Context
When your team arrives at the stadium (url), they have a game plan but must also make real-time decisions (action) on how to score or defend. In the digital scenario, once your request arrives at the specified web service, it needs to know what to do next, which is where the action comes in, guiding the service on how to process your request.

Just as a successful soccer play results in scoring a goal, a correctly executed digital action at the right url leads to a successful operation, like adding two numbers. Both scenarios require precision, strategy, and clarity of intent to achieve the desired outcome.

In essence, managing a soccer team and sending a request to a SOAP web service both involve knowing where to go and what to do once you get there. The url gets you to the right location, and the action ensures you execute the right play to score your goal, whether on the soccer field or in accomplishing a task using a web service.


Running Your Program
Open a terminal in your project directory.
Run the command dotnet run.
Watch as the scores are added and the total is displayed.
Celebrating the Score
Once the total score lights up the console, it's your cue for a victory dance. You've not just added numbers; you've seamlessly integrated the spirit of the game with the boundless possibilities of technology.

Congratulations, Coach! You're leading your team into a future where the love for sports meets the precision of digital innovation.
